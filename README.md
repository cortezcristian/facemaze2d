facemaze2d
==========

HTML5 game using Box2dJS and headtrackr. The basic idea for this game proof of concept was to allow players to resolve a random maze using their face movements. [See the demo](http://cortezcristian.com/facemaze2d/) You'll need to give permissions to your browser to control the camera, when prompted just click Allow.

[headtrackr](https://github.com/auduno/headtrackr/) is a javascript library that uses new browsers capabilities like getUserMedia to run a face recognition algorithm.


[box2d](http://box2d-js.sourceforge.net/) is a recognized Physics Engine ported for JS.
